	* INSTALL 1.4:
	New instructions on how to change the username and password.

	* README 1.10:
	Updated to be in sync with new instructions on how the password
	protection works.

	* phpshell.css 1.1: New file.

	* phpshell.php 1.23:
	Updated to use XHTML 1.0 Strict and the $_* variables in PHP
	4.1.0. This effectively breaks compatibility with earlier versions of
	PHP. If you cannot upgrade your PHP installation (you really should
	consider upgrading to get hold of the latest security and bug fixes)
	when just use PhpShell version 1.7 --- there's no new functionality in
	this release.

	* COPYING 1.1: New file.

	* phpshell.php 1.22: Changed PHP Shell into PhpShell.

	* phpshell.php 1.21: Added HTTP basic authentication to the script.

	* .htaccess 1.2:
	The .htaccess file will now prevent people from using phpshell.php on
	new installations before they have either deleted it or changed the
	path to the .htpasswd file.

	* AUTHORS 1.5: Moved Jeremy Miller <JMiller@marketaxess.com>.

	* phpshell.php 1.20: Updated version.

	* AUTHORS 1.4, phpshell.php 1.19:
	Applied patch from Michael Zech <keldrin@web.de> that made the
	stderr-checkbox remember it's state.

2002-09-18  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* phpshell.php 1.18:
	Use the directory of phpshell.php as the default working directory.

	* AUTHORS 1.3: Added Gerry Calderhead <caldergf@everythingsucks.co.uk>.

	* phpshell.php 1.17:
	PHP Shell now works on PHP 4.2.0 with register_globals turned off.

2002-06-10  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* INSTALL 1.3: Added a section about Safe Mode in PHP.

	* README 1.9:
	Added a section about Safe Mode in PHP. Also fixed a lot of spelling
	errors.

2002-03-23  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* README 1.8: Added a version number to the file.

	* AUTHORS 1.2: Added a notice about Robert Niess <sturm@i-st.net>.

	* phpshell.php 1.16:
	Added a PHPSHELL_VERSION constant. Also, when using stderr-trapping,
	we now use a unique filename as returned by tempnam() - Robert Niess
	<sturm@i-st.net> made me aware of this, thanks.

	* phpshell.php 1.15: Small changes in the layout.

	* phpshell.php 1.14:
	Updated copyright statements - they were getting quite old :-)

	* README 1.7:
	Added a tip from Jeremy Miller <JMiller@marketaxess.com> about how to
	use PHP Shell together with Sudo to execute code as another user.

2001-12-10  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* phpshell.php 1.13:
	I found out that 'ls -F' produced better output than 'ls -p'.

	* README 1.6: Told people about the rewriting of 'ls' into 'ls -F'

	* phpshell.php 1.12:
	You can now travel through the filesystem by using the normal 'cd'
	command. If your command involves 'cd', it will be intercepted and the
	current working directory will be changed accordingly.

	* README 1.5: Updated the documentation a bit.

2001-02-11  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* phpshell.php 1.11:
	Another suggestion from Thomas Langen <langen@langensoft.de>: some
	people can't use the .php extension, so now the script uses $PHP_SELF
	instead.

	* phpshell.php 1.10:
	Expanded all PHP start-tags (<?) to <?php, as suggested by Thomas
	Langen <langen@langensoft.de>.

	of the page ought to be enough :-)

2000-08-06  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* phpshell.php 1.6:
	Added a link to gimpster.com at the bottom of the page

2000-08-05  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* phpshell.php 1.5:
	Removed references to php3 - I now use php4 so all my files end with
	just a '.php'
