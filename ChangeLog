	* README 1.8: Added a version number to the file.

	* AUTHORS 1.2: Added a notice about Robert Niess <sturm@i-st.net>.

	<sturm@i-st.net> made me aware of this, thanks.

2001-12-10  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* phpshell.php 1.13:
	I found out that 'ls -F' produced better output than 'ls -p'.

	* README 1.6: Told people about the rewriting of 'ls' into 'ls -F'

	* phpshell.php 1.12:
	You can now travel through the filesystem by using the normal 'cd'
	command. If your command involves 'cd', it will be intercepted and the
	current working directory will be changed accordingly.

	* README 1.5: Updated the documentation a bit.

2001-02-11  Martin Geisler  <gimpster@gimpster.com>

	* phpshell.php 1.11:
	Another suggestion from Thomas Langen <langen@langensoft.de>: some
	people can't use the .php extension, so now the script uses $PHP_SELF
	instead.

	* phpshell.php 1.10:
	Expanded all PHP start-tags (<?) to <?php, as suggested by Thomas
	Langen <langen@langensoft.de>.
