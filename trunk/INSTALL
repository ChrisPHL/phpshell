Getting the tarball
-------------------
You can always get the latest version from my homepage:

Installation
------------
Installation is easy: first unpack the tarball or zipfile into your
webserver.  This will create a subdirectory called phpweather-1.8.

If you're using PhpShell on an Apache webserver running PHP as a
module, then PhpShell wont work until you've edited phpshell.php.  You
can see this when you try and load the file phpshell.php from the
directory just created --- you should get a prompt from your browser
asking you to authenticate you.  In the default setup, no username or
password will authenticate you, this what you'll have to change next.

In the phpshell.php file you'll find comments near the top that
explains how to enable access for a username with a password. In
short, you'll simply add the pair as an entry in the $passwd array
like this:

  $passwd = array('username' => 'password');

It is important that you password-protect PhpShell with a good
password.  If someone is able to guess your password, then they'll
have access to your webserver over the Internet, and they might be
able to erase your files, and perhaps even shutdown the webserver!  So
be careful with this and remember that you can always find the usual
disclaimer in the file LICENSE.  (This software is licensed under GPL,
I'm not responsible if you blow things up, etc... :-)


Safe Mode
---------
PhpShell doesn't work if PHP is running in Safe Mode.  There is
nothing I can do about this --- Safe Mode was made to prevent scripts
just like PhpShell.


Bugs?
-----
If you find a bug or miss something in PhpShell, please don't hesitate
to mail me at <gimpster@gimpster.com>!

Enjoy! - Martin Geisler <gimpster@gimpster.com>
