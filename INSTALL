Installation instructions for PHP Shell

Getting the tarball
-------------------
You can always get the latest version from my homepage:

  http://www.gimpster.com/php/phpshell/


Installation
------------
Installation is easy: just untar the tarball into your webserver, and
then type in the URL of the page phpshell.php. It should look
something like this:

  http://your.server.com/phpshell/phpshell.php

Please note, that PHP Shell doesn't work if PHP is running in Safe
Mode. There is nothing I can do about this - Safe Mode was made to
prevent scripts just like PHP Shell.


Password-protecting PHP Shell
-----------------------------
This will work, but i STRONGLY urge you to take a look at the file
sample.htaccess. You will be using it to password-protect PHP Shell.
To do so, first rename it to .htaccess, and then if you already have a
file with usernames and passwords for Apache, just change the bit
saying <path to auth-file> to the path of you file.

If you don't have such a file, then creating one is easy. Type the
following as root:

  $ htpasswd -c /home/httpd/auth_users <username>

This will create the file /home/httpd/auth_users and promt for a
password for the username supplied. If your Apache is installed
somewhere else, then just adjust the path in both the command above
and in the .htaccess-file.
If you need to add extra usernames and passwords, then leave out the
-c in the command above.
It is important that you password-protect PHP Shell, or else everybody
will have access to your webserver over the Internet. They will be
able to erase your files, and perhaps even shutdown the webserver!
So be careful with this and remember that you can always find the
usual disclaimer in the file LICENSE. (This software is licensed under
GPL, I'm not responsible if you blow things up, etc... :-)
