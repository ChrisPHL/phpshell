Thanks goes to all these persons who have helped:

  Fixed a problem the list of directories, if one accessed the
  root-directory.

  Made me aware of a security hole in the handling of stderr-trapping.

Gerry Calderhead <caldergf@everythingsucks.co.uk>
  Patch for PHP 4.2.0 where register_globals are turned off.

Jeremy Miller <JMiller@marketaxess.com>
  Suggested that one could use Sudo from

  to let PhpShell execute code with different privileges than the
  webserver.

  Patch to make the stderr-checkbox remember it's state.
